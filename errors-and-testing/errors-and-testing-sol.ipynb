Luckily, Python offers us a better option, which is a complete testing framework called [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html). We will use unittest because it is the standard one, but if you're doing other projects you might consider using better ones like [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) (note it can also execute tests made with unittest, so if your visualstudio code for some reason doesn't work with unittest, you can try setting pytest as test framework)\n",
