Unfortunately, one day an unethical biotech AI experiment goes wrong and a buggy cyborg is left free to roam in the building. To avoid panic, you are quickly asked to devise an evacuation plan. The place is a well known labyrinth, with endless corridors also looping into cycles. But you know you can model this network as a digraph, and decide to represent crossings as nodes. When a crossing has a door to leave the building, its label starts with letter `e`, while when there is no such door the label starts with letter `n`.\n",
