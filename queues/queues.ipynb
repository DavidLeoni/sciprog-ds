    "## 2. CircularQueue\n",
    "\n",
    "A circular queue is a data structure which when initialized occupies a **fixed** amount of memory called _capacity_. Typically, fixed size data structures are found in systems programming (i.e. programming drivers), when space is constrained and you want predictable results as much as possible. For us, it will be an example of modular arithmetic usage.\n",
    "In our implementation, to store data we will use a Python list, which we initialize with a number of empty cells equal to _capacity_. During initialization, it does't matter what we actually put inside cells, in this case we will use `None`.  Note that **capacity never changes**, and **cells are never added nor remove** from the list. What varies during execution is the actual content of the cells, the index pointing to the head of the queue (from which elements are dequeued) and another number we call _size_ which is a number telling us how many elements are present in the queue. Summing _head_ and _size_ numbers will allow us to determine where to enqueue elements at the tail of the queue - to avoid overflow, we will have to take modulus of the sum. Keep reading for details.\n",

    "* Initial queue will be populated with `None` objects, and will have length set to provided capacity\n",
    "* `_size` is the current dimension of the queue, which is different from the initial provided `capacity`.\n",
    "* we consider `capacity` as fixed: it will never change during execution. For this reason, since we use a Python list to represent the data, we don't need an extra variable to hold it, just getting the list length will suffice.\n",
    "* `_head` is an _index_ pointing to the _next_ element to be dequeued\n",
    "* elements are inserted at the position pointed to by `(_head + _size) % capacity()`, and dequeued from position pointed by `_head`. The module `%` operator allows using a list as it were circular, that is, if an index apparently falls outside the list, with the modulus it gets transformed to a small index. Since `_size` can never exceed `capacity()`,  the formula `(_head + _size) % capacity()` never points to a place which could overwrite elements not yet dequeued, except cases when the queue has `_size==0` or `_size==capacity()` which are to be treated as special.\n",
