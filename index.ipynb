In real life, junior programmers are often given by senior colleagues functions to implement based on specifications and possibly tests to make sure what they are implementing meets the specifications. Also, programmers copy code all of the time.  This is why during the exam I give you tests for the functions to implement so you can quickly spot errors, and also let you use the course material (see [exam modalities](#Exam-modalities)). \n"
