As a man she contracted with officials in Moray to be their witch pricker for one year.  She was paid 6 shillings a day and £6 for every witch who was found guilty.  She travelled and worked with a woman named Issobell Dick.  She claimed she could tell witches by sight, by looking into their eyes and that she learned her skill by watching John Kincaid, a witch pricker active in the Lothians.  She was accused of pricking 'many of his majesties leiges' in the sheriffdoms of Elgin, Forres, Nairn, Inverness, Ross and Sutherland.","LEM","06/13/02 10:16:44","LEM","10/08/02 15:28:50"
