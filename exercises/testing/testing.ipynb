    "As a fact of life, errors happen. Sometimes, your program may have inconsistent data, like wrong parameter type passed to a function (i.e. string instead of integer). A good principle to follow in these cases is to try have the program detect weird situations, and stop as early as such a situation is found (i.e. in the Therac 25 case, if you detect excessive radiation, showing a warning sign is not enough, it's better to stop). Note stopping might not always be the desirable solution (if one pidgeon enters one airplane engine, you don't want to stop all the other engines). If you want to check function parameters are correct, you do the so called _precondition checking_.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are roughly two cases for errors,  external user misusing you program, and just plain wrong code. Let's analyize both:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error kind a) An external user misuses you program.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can assume whover uses your software, final users or other programmers , they will try their very best to wreck your precious code by passing all sort of non-sense to functions. Everything can come in, strings instead of numbers, empty arrays, `None` objects ... In this case you should signal the user he made some mistake. The most crude signal you can have is raising an `Exception` with `raise Exception(\"Some error occurred\")`, which will stop the program and print the stacktrace in the console. Maybe final users won't understand a stacktrace, but at least programmers hopefully will get a clue about what's happening. \n",
    "\n",
    "In these case you can raise an appropriate Exception, like [TypeError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TypeError) for wrong types and [ValueError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#ValueError) for more generic errors. Other basic exceptions can be found in [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#built-in-exceptions). Notice you can also define your own, if needed (we won't consider custom exceptions in this course).\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: Many times, you can consider yourself the 'careless external user' to guard against. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's enrich the function with some appropriate type checking:\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for checking input types, you can use the function `type()` :"

    "## Functional programming\n",
    "\n",
    "In functional programming, functions behave as mathematical ones so they always take some parameter and return new data without ever changing the input. They say functional programming is easier to test. Why? \n",
    "\n",
    "**Immutable data structures**:  all data structures are (or are meant to be) immutable -> no code can ever tweak your data, so other developers just cannot (should not) be able to inadvertently change your data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Simpler parralel computing**:  point above is particularly inmportant in parallel computation, wheb the system can schedule thread executions differently _each_ time you run the program:  this implies that when you have multiple threads it can be very very hard to reproduce a bug where a thread wrongly changes a data which is supposed to be exclusively managed by another one, as it might fail in one run and succeed in another just because the system scheduled differently the code execution ! Functional programming frameworks like [Spark](https://spark.apache.org) solve these problems very nicely.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Easier to reason about code**: it is much easier to reason about functions, as we can use standard equational reasoning on input/outputs as traditionally done in algebra. To understand what we're talking about, you can see these slides: [Visual functional programming](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hTHty5aML9WDDTvkflvvdGDh0AfZwV_8ZEr10-rUPVA) (will talk more about it in class)"
