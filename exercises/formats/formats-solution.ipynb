When we open a file, Python is not capable to divine the encoding, and if we do not specify anything Python might open the file assuming an encoding different from the original - in other words, if we omit the encoding (or we put a wrong one) we might end up seeing weird characters (like little squares instead of accented letters).\n",

If it doesn't work try others, for example for files written in south Europe with Windows you might check `encoding='latin-1'`. If you open a file written elsewhere, you might need other encodings. For more in-depth information, you can read [Dive into Python - Chapter 4 - Strings](https://diveintopython3.problemsolving.io/strings.html), and [Dive into Python - Chapter 11 - File](https://diveintopython3.problemsolving.io/files.html), **both of which are extremely recommended readings**.\n",

Properly closing a file avoids to waste memory resources and creating hard to find paranormal errors. If you want to avoid hunting for never closed zombie files, always remember to open all files in `with` blocks!

Don't think this method is primitive or stupid, according to the situation it may save the day. How? Some files may potentially occupy huge amounts of memory, and in moder laptops as of 2019 we only have 4 gigabytes of RAM, the memory where Python stores variables. Given this, Python base functions to read files try their best to avoid loading everything in RAM. Tyipcally a file is read sequentially one piece at a time, putting in RAM only one row at a time."
